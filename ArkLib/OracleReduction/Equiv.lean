  # Equivalence / Isomorphism of Oracle Reductions

  We define observational equivalence between provers and verifiers in an I(O)R.

  We also define equivalence between IORs, in the sense that the statements and witnesses are
  equivalent, and their mapping commute with the reduction (both for the prover and the verifier).

  NOTE: this is now a special case of `liftContext`

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We will also need to convert between specification and executable models.

  In the best case, we have an isomorphism of the datatypes, which also intertwines with the
  implementation of the prover & verifier.

  However, we may need to deal with more complicated situation. For instance, can we transfer
  results between minor modifications to the protocol? What about when the isomorphism is not exact?

  For the simplest case, it seems we want the following:

  - Assume we have an I(O)R (i.e. the abstract specification): from `RIn₁ : StmtIn₁ × WitIn₁ → Prop`
      to `ROut₁ : StmtOut₁ × WitOut₁ → Prop`.

    We have another I(O)R (i.e. the executable implementation): from `RIn₂ : StmtIn₂ × WitIn₂ →
      Prop` to `ROut₂ : StmtOut₂ × WitOut₂ → Prop`.

    Assume there are mappings in opposite directions:
    `f{Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₁ : {Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₁ → {Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₂` &
    `g{Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₂ : {Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₂ → {Stmt/Wit}{In/Out}₁`.
    (for IOR, also mappings between the oracle statements)

  - Then we may transfer security properties from the first to the second I(O)R provided that:
    - Under these mappings, the relations are equivalent
    - Under these mappings, the prover & verifier are equivalent

  - Note that we do not need to require `f/g` to form an equivalence, since this may be too
    restrictive in practice (i.e. concrete polynomial datatypes may contain zero-padding of the
    highest coefficients).

/- Lots of TODOs here:

1. Specify equivalence of transcripts, provers, verifiers, reductions
2. Prove distributional equivalence of execution semantics
3. Prove preservation of security properties
