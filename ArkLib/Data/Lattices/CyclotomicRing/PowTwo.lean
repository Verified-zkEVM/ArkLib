# The Prime Power-of-Two Cyclotomic Ring `Z_q[X] / (X^{2^α} + 1)`

This file pins the cyclotomic modulus to the power-of-two cyclotomic polynomial
`X^{2^α} + 1` over the prime field `ZMod q`, and names the resulting ring.

This is the ring that underlies the Greyhound [NS24] / Hachi [NOZ26] / LaBRADOR-style
lattice constructions, and — more importantly for the algebraic development — it is the ring
in which Hachi [NOZ26, §3] identifies the finite field extensions `F_{q^k}` (via Galois
automorphisms, the trace map, and the packing map `ψ`). Those two consumers care about
*different* structure:

* the commitment-scheme security needs `q ≡ 5 (mod 8)` (Lyubashevsky–Seiler invertibility)
  and the power-of-two degree;
* the extension-field algebra (`CyclotomicRing/Galois/`, `CyclotomicRing/Subfield/`) needs the
  power-of-two degree `d = 2^α` so that the conductor `2d = 2^{α+1}` is a power of two, and
  `q` prime so that the fixed subring is a field.

The object lives here, in `Data/Lattices`, rather than next to any one consumer: it is pure
power-of-two cyclotomic ring theory over a prime field. The inner-outer commitment re-exports
it under the names `hachiModulus` / `HachiRing` (see
`ArkLib/Commitments/Functional/Hachi/InnerOuter/Arithmetic.lean`).

Because `primePowTwoModulus` is *reducibly* equal to `powTwoCyclotomic α`, the
`powTwoCyclotomic`-stated lemmas and the `IsCyclotomic` instance apply transparently.

## Main definitions

* `primePowTwoModulus q α` — the modulus `X^{2^α} + 1` over `ZMod q`.
* `PrimePowTwoRing q α` — the ring `Z_q[X] / (X^{2^α} + 1)`, a computable `CommRing`.
