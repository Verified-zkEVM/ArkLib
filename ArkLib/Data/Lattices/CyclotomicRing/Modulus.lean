# Cyclotomic Moduli over `CPolynomial`

This file defines the modulus data that turns a computable polynomial type
`CompPoly.CPolynomial R` into the cyclotomic ring `R[X] / (Φ_m)`.

Because Mathlib's `Polynomial.cyclotomic` is *noncomputable* (it routes through
roots of unity in `ℂ`), we cannot build the modulus by evaluating `cyclotomic`.
Instead a `CyclotomicModulus` bundles an *explicit* computable polynomial
`φ : CPolynomial R` (e.g. `X^d + 1`) together with

* a proof that `φ` is monic (needed for CompPoly's `modByMonic`-based reduction),
* its `conductor` `m`, and
* a proof linking it to the genuine cyclotomic polynomial,
  `φ.toPoly = Polynomial.cyclotomic m R`.

The canonical Hachi [NOZ26] instantiation is the power-of-two cyclotomic
`φ = X^{2^α} + 1`, of conductor `2^{α+1}`, provided as `powTwoCyclotomic`.

To keep the executable layer free of any noncomputable contamination, the data
and the proofs are kept in **separate** structures:

* `CyclotomicModulus R` is *pure computable data* (`φ`, `conductor`); reduction,
  multiplication and the vector/matrix operations depend only on it, so the
  canonical Hachi instance is fully `#eval`-able.
* `IsCyclotomic Φ` is a `Prop`-class bundling the two proof obligations
  (`monic`, `isCyclotomic`); only the (noncomputable) semantic bridge needs it.

## Main definitions

* `CyclotomicModulus R` — the computable modulus data.
* `IsCyclotomic Φ` — the cyclotomic-correctness proofs for a modulus.
* `CyclotomicModulus.powTwoCyclotomic α` — the Hachi modulus `X^{2^α} + 1`
  (computable), with its `IsCyclotomic` instance.
