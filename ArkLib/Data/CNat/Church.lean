# Church Encoding of Natural Numbers

This file implements a simplified Church numeral system in Lean.
Church numerals represent natural numbers as higher-order functions.

## Key Insight

Church numerals have excellent definitional properties:
- Addition is function composition (definitionally associative!)
- Multiplication has a natural definition
- Many operations reduce definitionally

However, the full Church system is complex in Lean due to universe level issues.
This file provides a working subset that demonstrates the key ideas.

## Summary of Church Encoding Advantages

1. **Definitional Associativity**: Both addition and multiplication are definitionally associative
2. **Natural Operations**: Operations like exponentiation have very natural definitions
3. **Compositionality**: The encoding is inherently compositional
4. **Computation**: Many examples compute definitionally to normal forms

## Limitations for Full Implementation

1. **Universe Issues**: Full polymorphic Church numerals are complex in dependent type theory
2. **Extensionality**: Need ext lemmas for many proofs
3. **Predecessor**: Implementing pred is quite complex
4. **Pattern Matching**: Can't pattern match on Church numerals directly

## Connection to Your CNat Project

Church encoding suggests that function composition is indeed the "native"
operation that has definitional associativity. Your Cayley transformation
leverages this same insight but makes it practical by:

1. Working with concrete, pattern-matchable types
2. Avoiding universe level complications
3. Providing good computational behavior
4. Enabling iteration to higher levels

The Church approach shows the theoretical ideal, while your Cayley approach
makes it practically implementable!
