  # Simple (Oracle) Reduction: Locally reduce a claim

  This is a zero-round (oracle) reduction. There is no witness.

  1. Reduction version: the input relation becomes a predicate on the statement. Verifier checks
     this predicate, and returns the same statement if successful.

  2. Oracle reduction version: the input relation becomes an oracle computation having as oracles
     the oracle statements, and taking in the (non-oracle) statement as an input (i.e. via
     `ReaderT`), and returning a `Prop`. Verifier performs this oracle computation, and returns the
     same statement & oracle statement if successful.

  In both cases, the output relation is trivial.
