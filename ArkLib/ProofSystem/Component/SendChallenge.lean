  # Simple Oracle Reduction - SendChallenge (the fold challenge round)

  A one-round, verifier-first (`V_to_P`) oracle reduction: the verifier samples a **challenge
  vector** `c : Fin ℓ → C`, sends it to the prover, and appends it to the output statement. There is
  no witness and **no check** — this is the definitional challenge-round building block of the
  Greyhound [NS24] / Hachi [NOZ26] fold ([NOZ26, Figure 3]), where `ℓ = 2ʳ` and `C ⊆ Rq`.

  A lone challenge round has no relation to extract into, so it is *not* coordinate-wise special
  sound on its own; its CWSS is established only as part of the surrounding fold block
  ([NOZ26, Lemma 8], out of scope here). What this file provides is:

  - the component itself (`oracleProver` / `oracleVerifier` / `oracleReduction`);
  - `instIsPure`: the verifier is pure — it reads the challenge off the transcript and appends it,
    with no runtime check — so it can be a left factor in a CWSS `append`;
  - `foldBlockStructure`: the `CWSSStructure` this round contributes to the block — one challenge
    round with `coordIndex = ℓ`, `alphabet = C`, `soundnessParam = 2` (so `arity = ℓ·(2−1)+1 = ℓ+1`
    and `nodeOk = IsSpecialSoundFamily ℓ 2`), matching [NOZ26, Lemma 4 / Definition 3] exactly.

  To *run* the reduction (completeness / soundness) one additionally needs
  `[SampleableType (Fin ℓ → C)]` (available from `[SampleableType C]` via the derived `Fin`-domain
  product instance); it is not required for the definitions, `IsPure`, or the structure above.

/-- The **fold-block coordinate-wise structure**: the single challenge round of `SendChallenge`
carries `ℓ` coordinates over the alphabet `C`, decomposed by the identity (`Challenge = Fin ℓ → C`
already), with soundness parameter `k = 2`. Hence `arity = ℓ·(2−1)+1 = ℓ+1` and the node predicate
is `IsSpecialSoundFamily ℓ 2` — exactly the branching required by [NOZ26, Lemma 4 / Definition 3]
(with `ℓ = 2ʳ`). This is the shape the fold block's CWSS ([NOZ26, Lemma 8]) is proven against. -/
