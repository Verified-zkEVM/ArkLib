# Implementation notes for the interaction core

These notes record where `ArkLib/Interaction/Core/` departs from the design records in this
directory. The records themselves are unchanged. Each entry states what the record said, what the
code does and why. Entries 1–8 were identified by the review of the first implementation; entries
9–12 were introduced while addressing that review, and entry 13 by core additions that the oracle
migration needs. The final section records later core changes that keep to the records; they are
not departures.

## 1. Oracle interfaces in positions; challenges indexed by node occurrences

Records D1 and D4 left open where an oracle payload's query interface lives and how challenges are
named. The code carries the interface in the oracle position (`OraclePos.oracle X interface` in
`Signature.lean`) and indexes challenges by structural node occurrences (`Node`, `ChallengeNode`
in `Protocol.lean`). This resolves the open choice without a separate decoration, and node
occurrences name each challenge independently of any transcript. Positions stay one universe above
moves and the monad, as D2 requires.

## 2. Observations retain the transcript and output on rejection

Records D4 and D7 describe a run that either outputs a statement or rejects. The code's
`Observation` keeps the full transcript and prover output together with an optional verdict
(`Execution.lean`), and `Reduction.run` gives the accepting `OptionT` presentation. Rejection is
therefore a returned observation, distinct from missing probability mass. In the classical
experiment every program is an `OracleComp`, which cannot fail, so rejection is the only way a run
can fail to accept; the security tests check that half the mass of a one-challenge run is a returned
rejection and that the total mass is one.

## 3. Oracle append and split are lawful maps with data round trips

Record D6 sketches routing through an equivalence of oracle signatures. The code represents
append and split by lawful `OracleMap`s with round-trip laws on the materialized data
(`OracleVerifier.lean`), with `payloadImpl_append` as the handler law. This is enough for both
materialization and query routing. It does not claim syntactic equality of query traces, which
the agreement law would not imply.

## 4. Adversary models are indexed by input and observation types

Record D7 attaches the adversary model to a verifier. The code's `AdversaryModel` is parameterized
by input and observation types, with an input-indexed adversary class; `OutputJudgement` decodes
the verdict and witness, and `StatementProblem` packages public context into the statement. The
generalization lets the same predicates serve plain and oracle verifiers and other models. A client
claiming correspondence with the legacy layer must choose the actual verdict and decode the actual
prover witness. Plain completeness and soundness have classical convenience predicates; oracle
security and knowledge assemble the generic predicate explicitly.

## 5. Errors in `ℝ≥0∞` with measurable observations

The legacy layer uses `ℝ≥0` errors. The code uses `ℝ≥0∞`, measurable observation spaces and
outer-measure upper bounds for general models; the classical wrappers use discrete observations,
so every event is measurable. The bounds are uninformative at error one or more, as usual.

## 6. Knowledge requires marginal preservation and an access budget

Record D9 section 4 asks knowledge soundness to preserve the run. The code requires the
extraction experiment's observation marginal to equal the model's outcome, adds an access-cost
budget counting adversary re-entry, and returns an optional witness, with an explicit `none`
counted as bad (`Knowledge.lean`). This prevents an extractor from deleting accepted mass. For a
general interface whose extractor can lose mass it is stronger than legacy `knowledgeSoundnessWith`,
whose bad event simply drops the missing mass, so a transfer from the legacy layer needs a
non-loss premise or a chosen failure-completion semantics. For the classical straight-line and
transcript-only interfaces the qualification is moot: `classicalStraightline_marginal` and
`classicalTranscriptOnly_marginal` prove that marginal preservation always holds, since the
extractor runs after the observation is fixed and `OracleComp` cannot lose mass.

## 7. Round-by-round terminal obligations cover every ambient state

The legacy terminal experiment starts from a fresh `init`. The code's `validAcceptance` asks for
positive acceptance probability from some ambient state (`RoundByRound.lean`). The interaction can
change shared state before the decision, so a fresh-state check could be evaded; the stronger
obligation needs suitable hypotheses for a transfer to the legacy layer. Structural spines with
full-move decorations give the state function and extractor the full prefix, including oracle
payloads.

## 8. Model definitions live in the security files

Record D9 sketches an optional `Model.lean`. The code defines models and extraction interfaces in
`Security/Completeness.lean` and `Security/Knowledge.lean`, and moves the `OracleFamily` helpers
to the neutral owner `ArkLib/Relation/Basic.lean`. Rewinding and quantum models, security
composition theorems, legacy execution and transfer theorems, and the focal-first to
counterpart-first exchange in distribution are outside this slice.

## 9. Oracle append needs output compatibility on accepted prefix results

Records D5 and D6 compose an oracle verifier by running the prefix decision and then the suffix
decision on the routed oracles, with the output map composed through the prefix output map and no
side condition. A composite output map, however, depends only on the statement, path and view,
whereas the suffix output map depends on the intermediate statement that the prefix decision
returns, possibly after ambient queries. The code therefore takes an `OutputCompatibility`
certificate. Its `agrees` field requires equality only for intermediate statements in the support
of `OracleVerifier.decideWith`, the prefix decision with its resource queries answered from the
routed input data and every ambient answer allowed. `OutputCompatibility.ofStatement` builds the
certificate when every accepted prefix result equals one public statement, and
`append_decideWith` states the routing law: the composed decision is the prefix decision followed
by the suffix decision on the routed data. Some condition is necessary: a prefix that returns an
ambient random bit, followed by a suffix whose output oracle exposes that bit, admits no
certificate, which a test checks. Compatibility depends on both verifiers: the same prefix
followed by a suffix whose output map ignores the bit does admit one. `ofStatement` gives a
sufficient condition, every accepted prefix result being one public statement; a test composes an
accepting zero-round prefix that returns `false` with the bit-dependent constant-oracle suffix,
and the composite accepts and returns the zero oracle.

## 10. Root obligations of state functions are guarded by the input promise

Record D7 sketches `toFun_root : ∀ stmt, toFun stmt root ⟨⟩ → stmt ∈ langIn` with no promise.
In the code both `StateFunction.root` and `KnowledgeStateFunction.root` assume
`admissible stmt`, and `KnowledgeStateFunction` takes the promise as a parameter. The error
obligations already quantify only over admissible inputs, and terminal knowledge soundness is also
promise-restricted. Without the guard, a zero-round protocol with promise `b = true` and
immediate extraction has no knowledge state function at all, because the terminal obligation on
the excluded input `false` forces the root relation on it.

## 11. The public-coin sampler is presented beside the pure-end sampler

Record D4 describes the sampler as the public-coin counterpart determined by the signature, with
replay from PolyFun. The code keeps `samplerEnd` and `sampler`, the pure-end form on which the
runner, `appendSampler` and the composition run laws are stated, and adds `publicCoinSampler` as a
PolyFun `PublicCoinCounterpart`. `toCounterpart_publicCoinSampler` and
`toCounterpart_publicCoinOracleSampler` prove that its conversion is the runner's sampler, and
`replay_publicCoinSampler` and `replay_publicCoinOracleSampler` that its replay draws nothing. The
bridge theorems are stated for `plainSig` and `oracleSig` rather than an arbitrary lens: the
definition casts along the owner of each position, and that cast reduces only once the signature
fixes the owner.

## 12. Path-fiber splitting stays in ArkLib

Record D5 splits paths and views at the seam with PolyFun's path operations and adds nothing to
ArkLib for it. `Fiber`,
`project_split` and `splitFiber` in `Composition.lean` are generic in the polynomial and the lens
but remain in ArkLib, marked as candidates for PolyFun; `project_split` is now derived from
PolyFun's `projectPathAlong_append`, `append_split` and `split_append` laws. The same holds for
`Node.appendEquiv` and `ChallengeNode.appendEquiv` in `Protocol.lean`, which split the node
occurrences and challenge nodes of an appended protocol into prefix and suffix-fibre parts. They
stay local to avoid a further PolyFun API change and repin beyond the merged lens work this slice
pins to; moving them to PolyFun is a follow-up.

## 13. The oracle decision log is recorded in the core

Record D6 assigns logged execution to the later oracle migration. The core's
`OracleVerifier.runWithLog` already logs the decision over the ambient oracles and the input and
message oracle families, before the resource queries are routed to the materialized data, so the
migration can read the resource queries without a second logged runner. Extractors still receive
only the ambient part, as record D7 requires: `OracleVerifier.runWithLog_fst` proves that the
`QueryLog.fst` of the decision log is the log of a run that records ambient queries alone, and the
oracle extraction game passes that projection.

## Continuation

Entries 14 onwards record the departures of the legacy embedding. They are in
[`legacy-embedding.md`](../interaction-layer/legacy-embedding.md#departures), and
[`departures.md`](../interaction-layer/departures.md) indexes every entry, including 1–13.

## Changes that keep to the records

### Output witnesses are indexed by the transcript

The round-by-round and straight-line knowledge interfaces took a constant output witness type,
although the prover's output `Out : PathAlong l s → Type` and the intermediate witnesses
`Witness sp history` of a knowledge state function were already indexed by the transcript. A
protocol whose output witness depends on a message, such as an index `Fin (payload + 1)` bounded
by a sent `payload`, had to encode that carrier into a constant type and track its compatibility
with the transcript separately. The old interfaces could not expose the transcript-indexed carrier
directly.

**Round-by-round knowledge** (`Security/RoundByRound.lean`). The output witness of
`KnowledgeStateFunction` and `rbrKnowledgeSoundness` is a family `W : PathAlong l s → Type`.
`validOutput` takes `(stmt : S) → (tr : PathAlong l s) → W tr → Prop`, and
`extractLeaf sp history stmt` takes `W (PrefixMoves.complete l sp history)`. The input witness
type `Win` stays a plain type. The verifier forms take the family implicitly, with output
relations

- `Verifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness`: `relOut : (tr : PathAlong plainSig s) → T → W tr → Prop`;
- `OracleVerifier.rbrKnowledgeSoundness`:
  `relOut : (tr : PathAlong oracleSig s) → (T × ∀ j, B j) → W tr → Prop`, where the second
  argument pairs the output statement with the output oracle data.

**Straight-line knowledge** (`Security/Knowledge.lean`). The extractor interfaces
`Extractor.Straightline`, `Extractor.TranscriptOnly`, `Extractor.OracleStraightline` and
`Extractor.OracleTranscriptOnly` take an output witness family `Wout : PathAlong plainSig s → Type`
or `Wout : PathAlong oracleSig s → Type`. Their arguments are ordered
`(stmt : S) → (tr : PathAlong _ s) → Wout tr → …`, so the witness is typed at the transcript passed
with it. The extraction games read the prover output through `readOut : ∀ tr, Out tr → Wout tr`;
the identity is a valid `readOut` when `Wout = Out`. The `withLogs` adapters, both extraction
games, `mem_support_extractionGame`, the classical interfaces and their marginal lemmas carry the
family. `Prover`, the generic `knowledgeSoundnessWith` and `knowledgeSoundness`, and the input
witness types are unchanged.

There is one theory for each notion. Constant witness types are the constant family `fun _ => W`
at the use site. The legacy round-by-round transfers in `Legacy/Security.lean` and
`Legacy/OracleSecurity.lean` use `fun _ => WitOut` and the output relation
`fun _ t w => (t, w) ∈ relOut`. The legacy extractor lifts `liftExtractor` and
`liftOracleExtractor` use `fun _ => WitOut` and only reorder the transcript and witness arguments.
Relations, errors and extractor behavior are as before.

The tests in `ArkLibTest/Interaction/Core/Security.lean` use the carrier `Fin (payload + 1)`
directly. In `payloadKnowledge` it is the leaf witness, and the input relation follows from its
bound together with the acceptance equality `payload = stmt`; `payloadKnowledge_extract` gives
the extraction equation for every payload. In `payload_extractionGame` a prover outputs
`w : Fin 8` after sending `7`, the identity `readOut` passes it to the extractor, and the accepting
run extracts `w.val`.

This keeps to record D7, whose problems already index witness types by the claim; D7 fixes no
constant output witness type for either notion.

## 20. Sumcheck ports

**Plan.** The frozen Sumcheck assertions include interval execution, a univariate standalone
round through a virtual projection, and two rounds through an exported oracle. Decisions OQ4,
OQ11, OQ16 and OQ18 assign their ports to D7 after C2. Entries 19 and 21 belong to other D commits;
D7 uses 20.

**Code.** `Sumcheck/Core/SingleRound.lean` supplies `projectionMap` with
`projectedRoundPolynomial` as its data map, `simulateProjectedRoundPolynomial` as its query
implementation, and `simulateProjectedRoundPolynomial_eq` as its law. There is no second
univariate protocol. `Core/Composition.lean` supplies `projectedVerifier`, whose output map
composes that projection with the input-slot embedding. Its statement retains the accumulated
challenges; its output oracle is the univariate projected polynomial. The accepted verdict
satisfies the simple evaluation relation, and with the original input it satisfies the next
`Spec.relationRound`.

`run_append_verifier` states Protocol #7 at full `n + 1`, including an effectful suffix constructor
in `Prover.append` and the actual `OracleVerifier.append`. `foldVerifier` uses the existing legacy
decision fold, allowing its suffix statement family to start at round 1. It adds no interval
runner or soundness theorem.

The routing test uses `ZMod 17` polynomials, matching C's concrete fixtures, with natural-number
ambient event answers and an arbitrary private `hidden : Nat`. It preserves the recorded query
order `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, accepted claim `(10, 10)` and exact private output `hidden + 110`. Polynomial
arithmetic is in the field; private output arithmetic does not wrap. As D5 requires, a prefix
rejection still runs both interactions, then skips the suffix decision. The frozen early-abort
trace `[3]` and private output `hidden + 50` are replaced by the full trace and `hidden + 110`.
Suffix rejection retains the same full trace.

`Spec.polynomialFamily` replaces the former interaction namespace and C's duplicate `polyFamily`.
The old interaction name is a documented plain alias for the untouched frozen layer and runtime
script until D9. `Spec.relationRound_last_iff` is the production source of the final evaluation
relation. The new tests keep standard-axiom guards and also check relations on the actual
returned verdicts of the projected and embedded runs.

**Why.** These restatements implement the approved passive decision boundary and the full-`n`
execution choice. The projection construction and multivariate evaluation remain noncomputable
mathematical views inherited from `Spec`; the generic executable carrier is D8's task under
OQ17. No frozen assertion is silently retired. The
[Sumcheck disposition table](../interaction-layer/sumcheck.md#migration-disposition) names each
port and the existing B coverage. Generic routing, composition/runtime soundness and implications
that are absent from this base wait on D1/D5/D6; they are listed separately there, without
copying modules from those branches.
