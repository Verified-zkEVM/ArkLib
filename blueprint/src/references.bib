  abstract   = {A new algebraic technique for the construction of interactive proof systems is presented. Our technique is used to prove that every language in the polynomial-time hierarchy has an interactive proof system. This technique played a pivotal role in the recent proofs that IP = PSPACE [28] and that MIP = NEXP [4].},
