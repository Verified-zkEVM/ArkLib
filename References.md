- [Linear-Size Constant-Query IOPs for Delegating Computation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1230.pdf) (introduces IOR)
- Reductions of Knowledge (introduces interactive reductions of knowledge)
- Arc paper (re-introduces IOR)
- WHIR paper (introduces $$\mathcal{F}$$-IOP; though the notion has appeared in prior talks & conversations with Dan Boneh)
